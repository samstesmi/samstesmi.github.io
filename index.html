I am an early career neuroscientist working at the University of Nottingham. My research investigates the auditory brain, integrating cutting-edge quantitative techniques and experimental data. I am particularly interested in understanding:
* Human identification of speech in noisy environments
* Abnormal auditory perception
* Hearing impairment
Beyond auditory science, I am fond of blues music (listening & playing) and enjoy heading outdoors (often by bike).
