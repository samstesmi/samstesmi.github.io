I am an early career scientist working in Nottingham, UK. My research focuses on the auditory brain, integrating cutting-edge quantitative techniques and experimental data. I am particularly interested in:
* speech recognition in tricky circumstances
* abnormal auditory perception
* hearing impairment

Beyond auditory science, I am fond of blues music and enjoy heading outdoors.
