## About
When presented with two vowels simultaneously, humans are often able to identify the constituent vowels. Computational models exist that simulate this ability, however they predict listener confusions poorly, particularly in the case where the two vowels have the same fundamental frequency. Presented here is a model that is uniquely able to predict the combined representation of concurrent vowels. The given model is able to predict listener's systematic perceptual decisions to a high degree of accuracy.
