I am an early career scientist working in Boston, USA. My research straddles the boundaries of hearing, neuroscience, and computational analysis. Areas of interest include:
* Why can, or can't, people hear speech in noisy places?
* Modern solutions to hearing disorders such as tinnitus.
* Inference of auditory processing via machine learning.

Outside of the lab (the [Polley Lab](https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab/)), I am fond of blues music and enjoy being active outdoors.
