I"<p>I am an early career neuroscientist working at the University of Nottingham. My research investigates the auditory brain, integrating cutting-edge quantitative techniques and experimental data. I am particularly interested in understanding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human identification of speech in noisy environments</li>
  <li>Abnormal auditory perception</li>
  <li>Hearing impairment</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond auditory science, I am fond of blues music (listening &amp; playing) and enjoy heading outdoors (often by bike).</p>
