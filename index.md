I am an early career scientist working in Boston, USA. My research straddles the boundaries of hearing, neuroscience, and computational analysis. Topcs of interest include:
* Why can, or can't, people hear speech in noisy places?
* Inferring auditory processing via machine learning.
* Rehabilitative approaches to hearing disorders such as tinnitus.

Beyond research, I am fond of blues music and enjoy being outdoors.
